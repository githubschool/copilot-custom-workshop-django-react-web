[Prev - Story about Mona's dream to make her dream a reality](../1_Story/README.md.md) | [Next - Build a PostgreSQL database layer using Docker container](./3_Build_a_PostgreSQL_database_layer_using_Docker_container.md)

## High Level View about what we will build

1. Build a PostgreSQL database layer using Docker container
2. Create a simple database connection script to check connection to PostgreSQL
