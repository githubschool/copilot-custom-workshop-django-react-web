# Before getting started

[Prev - Story about Mona's dream to make her dream a reality](../1_Story/README.md.md) | [Next - Build a PostgreSQL database layer using Docker container](../3_BuildPostgreSQL/README.md)

## High Level View about what we will build

![High Level View](images/ArchitectureStacks.jpg)

1. Build a PostgreSQL database layer using Docker container
2. Create a simple database connection script to check connection to PostgreSQL
3. Create a Python Django backend that connects to database and expose REST API
4. Create a ReactJS front end server that connects to Python Djangoâ€™s REST
5. Deploy the application infrastructure layer (stretch goal)

## Right audience for this workshop:

This workshop should be ideal for customers who meets the following requirements:
- Either went through a basic Copilot 101 training or have familiarity with GitHub Copilot
- Prefer an advanced Copilot that involves a full web-end stack with Python Django, ReactJS, and a database layer

## Prerequisites

As a GitHub engineer who delivers this workshop, you should make sure that you have the following environments setup if you want to follow along.

- Access to Copilot license
- Access to Copilot Chat with Copilot for Business License
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) with [Copilot](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot) and [Copilot Chat](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=GitHub.copilot-chat)
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) with an ability to get base images from DockerHub
- You have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [PIP](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/cli/pip_install/) installed on your computer and can install dependencies
- You have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/download) installed
- You have the [Git CLI](https://git-scm.com/downloads) installed

## Expected Outcomes

At the end of this workshop, you should be able to build a full stack web application that has a Python Django backend, ReactJS front end, and a PostgreSQL database layer with GitHub Copilot.

## Recommended setup

It is recommended that you created a separate parent folder with individual folders for each of the following components:
- `backend` - Python Django backend
- `frontend` - ReactJS frontend
- `database` - PostgreSQL database layer
- `automation` - Automation scripts to build the application infrastructure layer
